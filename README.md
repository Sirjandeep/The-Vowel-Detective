"The Vowel Detective" Once upon a time in the bustling city of Linguoville, there lived a detective named Sam. Sam was not like any other detective; Sam was "The Vowel Detective." 
Sam had a unique ability to decipher the secrets hidden within words, specifically the secrets of vowels and consonants. 
One bright morning, a concerned citizen named Emily visited Detective Sam's office. She had received a mysterious letter with a coded message, and she couldn't make heads or tails of it.
The only clue she had was that the message was filled with letters. 
Emily handed the letter to Detective Sam, who immediately put on a thinking cap adorned with the #letters A, E, I, O, and U.
